// C++ program to illustrate the
// capacity function in vector

FUNCTION DESCRIPTIONS :

1  size() – Returns the number of elements in the vector.

2  max_size() – Returns the maximum number of elements that the vector can hold.

3  capacity() – Returns the size of the storage space currently allocated to the vector expressed as number of elements.

4  resize(n) – Resizes the container so that it contains ‘n’ elements.

5  empty() – Returns whether the container is empty.

6  shrink_to_fit() – Reduces the capacity of the container to fit its size and destroys all elements beyond the capacity.

7  reserve() – Requests that the vector capacity be at least enough to contain n elements.

SAMPLE OUTPUT :
