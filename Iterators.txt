// C++ program to illustrate the
// iterators in vector

FUNCTION DESCRIPTIONS :

1  begin() – Returns an iterator pointing to the first element in the vector

2  end() – Returns an iterator pointing to the theoretical element that follows the last element in the vector

3  rbegin() – Returns a reverse iterator pointing to the last element in the vector (reverse beginning). It moves from last to first element

4  rend() – Returns a reverse iterator pointing to the theoretical element preceding the first element in the vector (considered as reverse end)

5  cbegin() – Returns a constant iterator pointing to the first element in the vector.

6  cend() – Returns a constant iterator pointing to the theoretical element that follows the last element in the vector.

7  crbegin() – Returns a constant reverse iterator pointing to the last element in the vector (reverse beginning). It moves from last to first element

8  crend() – Returns a constant reverse iterator pointing to the theoretical element preceding the first element in the vector (considered as reverse end)
