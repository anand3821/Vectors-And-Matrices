// C++ program to illustrate the
// Modifiers in vector

FUNCTION DESCRIPTIONS :

1  assign() – It assigns new value to the vector elements by replacing old ones

2  push_back() – It push the elements into a vector from the back

3  pop_back() – It is used to pop or remove elements from a vector from the back.

4  insert() – It inserts new elements before the element at the specified position

5  erase() – It is used to remove elements from a container from the specified position or range.

6  swap() – It is used to swap the contents of one vector with another vector of same type. Sizes may differ.

7  clear() – It is used to remove all the elements of the vector container

8  emplace() – It extends the container by inserting new element at position

9  emplace_back() – It is used to insert a new element into the vector container, the new element is added to the end of the vector


SAMPLE OUTPUT :
The vector elements are: 10 10 10 10 10 
The last element is: 15
The vector elements are: 10 10 10 10 10
The first element is: 5
The first element is: 10
The first element is: 5
The last element is: 20
Vector size after erase(): 0

Vector 1: 1 2
Vector 2: 3 4
After Swap
Vector 1: 3 4
Vector 2: 1 2
